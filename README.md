Explanation and Justification:
Image Acquisition:
   - Acquire images of concrete blocks using the RGB camera system.

Load Images:
   - Load images from the specified folders for both defective and defectless concrete cracks.

Image Prepocessing & Enhancement:
   - Enhance the images to improve their quality and highlight important features. In the provided code, histogram equalization and Gaussian filtering are applied.
   - These enhancements help in improving the contrast and reducing noise in the images, which can make subsequent feature extraction more effective.
   - Normalization: Normalize the pixel values to a common scale to ensure consistent feature representation.

Feature Extraction:
   - Extract features from the enhanced images. In the code, Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) features are extracted.
   - HOG is widely used for object detection in computer vision tasks and is particularly effective for detecting object shapes and textures. It captures the distribution of gradient orientations in localized portions of an image.

Data Splitting:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets. This ensures that the model's performance can be evaluated on unseen data.

Training Classifier:
   - Train a classifier using the extracted features and their corresponding labels. In the code, a Random Forest Classifier is used.
   - Random Forests are capable of handling high-dimensional data and are robust to overfitting. The n_estimators parameter controls the number of trees in the forest.

Testing Classifier:
   - Test the trained classifier on the testing dataset to evaluate its performance.

System Diagram Structure Based on Question 3

1. **Image Acquisition**: Acquire images of concrete blocks using the RGB camera system.

2. **Image Preprocessing**:
   - **Image Enhancement**: Enhance the acquired images to improve their quality and make the features more distinguishable. This can include techniques like:
     - Histogram equalization to improve contrast.
     - Gaussian or median filtering to reduce noise.
   - **Normalization**: Normalize the pixel values to a common scale to ensure consistent feature representation.

3. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Identify relevant features from the preprocessed images that can effectively discriminate between defective and defectless concrete blocks. 
   - Extract these features from the preprocessed images.

4. **Train-Test Split**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the performance of the model. This ensures the model's generalization to unseen data.

5. **Classifier Training**:
   - Choose a suitable classification algorithm based on the nature of the problem (binary classification of images).
   - The classifier we are using is the random forest classifier
   - Train the selected classifier using the training dataset and the extracted features.

6. **Classifier Testing**:
   - Evaluate the trained classifier on the testing dataset to assess its performance.
   - Calculate performance metrics how the model can differentiate between defective and defectless concrete blocks.
